# Calculator Component

This was created as a clone of the Windows calculator app.

The idea of this is to have a pop up calculator from the press of a button, which has memory handling from React-Redux, including a scientific mode.
In current development stage, most of the calculator is working as expected, there has been some issues I have noted, and are fixing as I add more features.
